# backgammon

### Reason for Project
This project is written so I can keep track of backgammon statistics and facts. Some of this will be Monte Carlo simulations to confirm what I have 
learned, while other pieces will include links to other sites about backgammon, random statistics about the game I need to verify, my historical games 
for people to puruse, and random pieces of trivia about the game.
