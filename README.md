# backgammon

### Reason for Project
This project is written so I can keep track of backgammon statistics and facts. Some of this will be Monte Carlo simulations to confirm what I have 
learned, while other pieces will include links to other sites about backgammon, random statistics about the game I need to verify, my historical games 
for people to puruse, and random pieces of trivia about the game. 

Some of you will think it is odd to do this in Python, but it gives me a chance to document some of the things I have learned about the language. If you
keep reading this page, you will see it expand over time with little snippets of code.
